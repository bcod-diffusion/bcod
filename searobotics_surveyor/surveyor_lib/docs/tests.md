# Manual for Creating and Testing New Feature Implementations

This document provides a step-by-step guide to safely create and test new features in the project without affecting the current implementation.

---

## 1. Set Up a Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Ensure you have a local copy of the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```
# Manual for Creating and Testing New Feature Implementations

This document provides a step-by-step guide to safely create and test new features in the project without affecting the current implementation.

## 1. Set Up a Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Ensure you have a local copy of the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Create a New Branch:**
   Create a new branch for your feature to avoid modifying the main branch.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<feature_name>
   ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 2. Implement the New Feature

1. **Add New Code:**
   - Create new files or modify existing ones as needed.
   - Follow the existing project structure and coding standards.

2. **Document Your Changes:**
   - Add comments and docstrings to explain your code.
   - Update any relevant documentation files.

3. **Write Unit Tests:**
   - Add tests for your feature in the `tests/` directory.
   - Use descriptive test names and cover edge cases.

---

## 3. Test the New Feature

1. **Run Unit Tests:**
   Use `pytest` to run all tests, including the ones for your new feature.
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

2. **Test in Isolation:**
   If your feature involves a server or client, run it in isolation to verify functionality.
   ```bash
   python <server_or_client_file>.py
   ```

3. **Check for Regressions:**
   Ensure that existing functionality is not broken by running all tests.

4. **Use Temporary Data:**
   Use temporary directories or mock data to avoid modifying real data during testing.

---

## 4. Debug and Refine

1. **Fix Issues:**
   Address any errors or failing tests.

2. **Refactor Code:**
   Optimize your implementation for readability and performance.

3. **Re-run Tests:**
   Ensure all tests pass after making changes.

---

## 5. Submit Your Changes

1. **Commit Your Changes:**
   Write a clear and concise commit message.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add <feature_name>: <short_description>"
   ```

2. **Push Your Branch:**
   Push your branch to the remote repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/<feature_name>
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request:**
   Open a pull request to merge your feature branch into the main branch. Include:
   - A description of the feature.
   - Any relevant screenshots or logs.
   - A summary of tests performed.

---

## 6. Rollback Plan

1. **Backup Current State:**
   Before deploying your feature, ensure the current state is backed up.

2. **Revert Changes if Needed:**
   If your feature causes issues, revert to the previous state.
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git reset --hard <last_stable_commit>
   ```

---

## 7. Best Practices

- **Work in Isolation:**
  Use feature branches and virtual environments to avoid conflicts.
  
- **Write Tests First:**
  Use test-driven development (TDD) to ensure your feature works as expected.

- **Keep Changes Small:**
  Implement and test one feature at a time to simplify debugging.

- **Communicate:**
  Keep your team informed about your progress and any challenges.

By following this guide, you can safely implement and test new features without disrupting the current functionality.
